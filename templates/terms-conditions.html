            </p>

              We strongly advise You to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites
              or services that You visit.
            </p>
            <h2>Termination</h2>
            <p>
              We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason
              whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.
            </p>
            <p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>
            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
              Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its
              suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be
              limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased
              anything through the Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be
              liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
              limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for
              personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use
              the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in
              connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the
              possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
              consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each
              party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
            </p>
            <h2>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>
              The Service is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty
              of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on
              behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims
              all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including
              all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement,
              and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice.
              Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no
              representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be
              compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without
              interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects
              can or will be corrected.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's provider makes any
              representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the
              Service, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Service
              will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information
              or content provided through the Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails
              sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware,
              timebombs or other harmful components.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable
              statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to
              You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the
              greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.
            </p>
            <h2>Governing Law</h2>
            <p>

            <p>
              You represent and warrant that (i) You are not located in a country that is subject to the United States

              Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation
              under these Terms shall not affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at
              any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
            </p>
